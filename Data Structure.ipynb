What are data structures, and why are they important?\n","    Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and accessing collections of data.\n","    They provide efficient ways to manage information based on its characteristics and intended use.\n","    Well-chosen data structures can:\n","\t      Simplify data manipulation (adding, removing, modifying elements)\n","\t      Optimize searching and sorting operations\n","\t      Conserve memory usage\n","\n","2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n","      Mutable : Can be changed after creation. E.g. Lists, dictionaries, sets.\n","      Immutable : Cannot be changed after creation.E.g. Strings, tuples, numbers.\n","\n","3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","    Differences between lists and tuples in Python\n","     Mutability:\n","       Lists:  Mutable, elements can be modified after creation (add, remove, change).\n","       Tuples: Immutable, elements cannot be modified after creation.\n","     Syntax:\n","       Lists:  Defined using square brackets [].\n","       Tuples: Defined using parentheses ().\n","     Performance:\n","       Lists:  Slightly slower due to their mutable nature.\n","       Tuples: Faster and more memory efficient, as they don't need the overhead for potential changes.\n","     Use Cases:\n","       Lists: Use when you need a collection of items that can be modified.\n","       Tuples: Use when you need a fixed collection of items that should not be changed (e.g., coordinates, database records).\n","\n","4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","       Dictionaries in Python store data as key-value pairs using a structure called a hash table.\n","       This allows for highly efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion, with an average time complexity of O(1) for these operations.\n","\n","5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","   Sets are preferred over list in Python in below case:\n","    1.Sets automatically enforce unique elements, meaning they do not allow duplicates.\n","    2.Sets allows faster operation than a list because sets are implemented as hash tables.\n","    3.Sets support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n","\n","6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","      A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes.\n","      A list is a sequence of items, where each item could be anything (an integer, a float, a string, etc).\n","\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","      Tuples ensure data integrity in Python through their immutability. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.\n","      This makes tuples a reliable way to store data that should remain constant throughout the program's execution.\n","\n","8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","    A hash table uses a hash function to map keys to specific indices in an array (called buckets).\n","    These indices determine where the values associated with the keys are stored.\n","    Python dictionaries are built on hash tables, providing constant-time complexity (O(1)) for basic operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup, in the average case.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","     Yes.A list is a sequence of items, where each item could be anything (an integer, a float, a string, etc).\n","\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","      The immutability of Python string is very useful as it helps in hashing, performance optimization, safety, ease of use, etc.\n","\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","     Scenarios where dictionaries are preferred over lists:\n","      Storing user information: Using usernames as keys to access user details like email addresses and passwords.\n","      Mapping data: Associating one set of values with another, like translating words between languages.\n","      Caching data: Storing frequently accessed data with quick access using key\n","\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","      Scenarios where tuple are preferred over lists:\n","        Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once created. This is useful for situations where it is required  to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental modifications.\n","        Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable (due to their immutability), while lists cannot.\n","        Tuples can sometimes be slightly faster than lists for accessing elements because of their fixed structure.\n","\n","13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","      Sets in Python are inherently designed to handle duplicate values by automatically eliminating them.\n","      When you create a set or add elements to it, only unique values are retained.\n","\n","14. How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","      When using the \"in\" keyword, it checks if a value exists within a list by comparing it to each element in the list.\n","      In a dictionary, \"in\" checks if a value exists as a key within the dictionary, meaning it only looks for the key and not the associated value\n","\n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n","      No. Tuple is immutable meaning we cannot modify element after creation.\n","\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","        A nested dictionary is a data structure where a dictionary contains other dictionaries as its values, essentially creating a hierarchical organization of key-value pairs within a single dictionary\n","        E.g. people = {1: {'name': 'John', 'age': '27', 'sex': 'Male'}, 2: {'name': 'Marie', 'age': '22', 'sex': 'Female'}}\n","\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","       Iterating over keys, values, or items in a dictionary has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the dictionary.\n","\n","18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","      Scenarios where lists are preferred over dictionaries:\n","         When order matters\n","         When it is required to store multiple instances of the same value:\n","         When it is required to access elements by position/index:\n","         When it is required to perform sequential operations:\n","         When the dataset is simple:\n","\n","\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","      A dictionary is termed an unordered collection of objects because dictionaries do not maintain any inherent order of the items based on when they were added.\n","      Despite dictionaries being unordered, data retrieval by key remains efficient and direct because Python dictionaries are designed for fast key lookups using hash tables.\n","      This means you can still retrieve a value by its key in constant time  O(1)) on average, regardless of the dictionary's order.\n","\n","20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","      A list is an ordered collection of items, whereas a dictionary is an unordered data collection in a key: value pair.\n","      Elements from the list can be accessed using the index, while the elements of the dictionary can be accessed using keys.\n","\n","'''"],"metadata":{"id":"WUpvjCb7HbHh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["##1.
