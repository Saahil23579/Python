What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\\n    A function is a block of reusable code defined using the def keyword.It is not tied to any specific object and can exist independently in a module or script.\\n    A method is a function that is associated with an object or class. Methods are defined inside a class and operate on the object or class they belong to.\\n\\n2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\\n   Parameters are variables that are defined in the function\\'s declaration (signature) and act as placeholders for the values that the function will receive when called.They appear inside the parentheses of the function definition.\\n   Arguments are the actual values or data you pass to the function when calling it. They appear inside the parentheses of the function call.\\n\\n3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python? \\n   In Python, you can define and call functions in several ways:\\n    Function Defination:\\n      1.Standard Function Definition.\\n      2.Lambda Function (Anonymous Function)\\n   Function Calling:\\n      1.Direct Call.\\n      2.Calling through a Variable.\\n      3.Calling from a Module.\\n      4.Calling as a Method (if part of a class)\\n\\n4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function? \\n   The return statement in Python serves two primary purposes:\\n     1. Exiting a Function\\n     2. Returning a Value\\n\\n5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\\n    In Python, an \"iterable\" is any object that can be looped over using a \"for\" loop, like a list, tuple, or string, while an \"iterator\" is an object that provides a mechanism to iterate through the elements of an iterable, one at a time.\\n\\n6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined. \\n   In Python, a generator is a function that returns an iterator that produces a sequence of values when iterated over. \\n   We can define a generator function using the def keyword, but instead of the return statement we use the yield statement. Here, the yield keyword is used to produce a value from the generator.\\n\\n7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\\n    When the generator function is called, it does not execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over to produce the values.\\n    Generators are useful when we want to produce a large sequence of values, but we don\\'t want to store all of them in memory at once.\\n\\n8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\\n   A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the \"lambda\" keyword, typically used for quick, simple operations where a full function definition might be unnecessary, like performing a single calculation .\\n\\n9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\\n   The map() function is used to apply a given function to every item of an iterable, such as a list or tuple, and returns a map object (which is an iterator).\\n    \\n10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce(), and `filter()` functions in Python?\\n    Map applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or set) and returns a list of the results. \\n    Filter constructs a list from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. \\n    Reduce  applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list and returns a single result.\\n\\n11.
