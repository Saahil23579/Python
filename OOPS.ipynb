What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","   Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model based on the concept of objects and classes which can help create software programmes, and includes basic principles like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction.\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","   In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. A class acts as a design for objects, allowing you to model real-world entities in your program.\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","   In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity or concept and encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class.\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","   Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object to the user. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n","   Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. It focuses on how an object protects its data.\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","   Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) are special methods in Python with names that begin and end with double underscores (__).\n","   They are also known as magic methods or special methods. These methods are predefined in Python to enable objects to interact with built-in functions, operators, and common language constructs in a clean and intuitive way.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","   Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing for code reuse and extensibility.\n","   In inheritance, a class called the derived class inherits the attributes and methods of a base class. The derived class can extend the base class's functionality by adding new features or overriding existing ones\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","   Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of a single function, method, or class to behave differently based on the context in which it is used.\n","   It enables a single interface to represent different types, enhancing flexibility and code reusability.\n","\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","   Encapsulation in Python is achieved by organizing data (attributes) and the methods that operate on it within a class and controlling access to this data.\n","   Python provides mechanisms like access modifiers and properties to implement encapsulation effectively.\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","   In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. It is defined using the __init__ method within a class.\n","   The constructor is automatically called when an object of the class is instantiated.\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","    In Python, class methods and static methods are special types of methods within a class that differ in how they access the class and its instances.\n","    They are defined using decorators, and their behavior is distinct from regular instance methods.\n","\n","    Class Method :A method that operates on the class itself rather than an instance of the class.\n","    Static Method: A method that does not depend on class or instance variables and works like a regular function, but it is logically related to the class.\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","    Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different arguments. It allows a method to perform different tasks based on the number or types of arguments passed.\n","\n","    However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, as it only allows one method with a given name per class.\n","    In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, the most recently defined method will overwrite the previous ones.\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","    Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the one in the superclass.\n","    This allows the subclass to provide a behavior specific to its own needs while still adhering to the structure defined by the superclas\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","    In Python, a property decorator (@property) is used to define a method in a class as a property. This allows us to access the method as if it were an attribute, rather than calling it like a method.\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","    Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that enables a single interface to represent different types or classes.\n","    It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is achieved through method overriding, interfaces, or inheritance, and it plays a crucial role in making OOP flexible, extensible, and reusable\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","    An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. It serves as a blueprint for other classe\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","    Advantages of OOP:\n","    1.Re-usability. It means reusing some facilities rather than building them again and again.\n","    2.Data Redundancy\n","    3.Code Maintenance\n","    4.Security\n","    5.Better productivity\n","    6.Easy troubleshooting\n","    7.Polymorphism Flexibility\n","\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","    Class variable :\n","                    A class variable is a variable that is defined in a class and exists as a single copy, regardless of the number of class instances.\n","                    Class variables are suitable for data that needs to be consistent across a class hierarchy.\n","    Instance Variable :\n","                    An instance variable is a variable that is defined in a class and has a separate copy for each instance of the class.\n","                    Instance variables are ideal for storing data that is specific to an instance.\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","    Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n","    This allows the derived class to access and use attributes and methods from all of its parent classes\n","\n","19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__' and '__repr__'' methods in Python.\n","     The __str__ method is meant to provide a human-readable or informal string representation of an object.\n","     Itâ€™s typically used to display information about the object in a friendly or user-facing format.\n","\n","     The __repr__ method is meant to provide a developer-readable or formal string representation of an object.\n","     It is typically used to give detailed information that could be useful for debugging or reconstructing the object.\n","\n","\n","20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n","    The super() function in Python is significant because it allows you to call methods from a parent class (also known as a superclass) in a child class.\n","    This is especially useful in the context of inheritance, where a subclass inherits attributes and methods from a superclass.\n","\n","21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","    The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as a destructor, that is called when an object is about to be destroyed by the garbage collector.\n","    Its primary purpose is to define cleanup actions that need to occur when an object is no longer needed.\n","\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","    In Python, @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that do not operate in the traditional sense on an instance of a class.\n","    However, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.A static method is a method that belongs to a class but does not depend on or modify the class or instance state.\n","    It is essentially a function that resides within a class for organizational purposes.A class method is a method that operates on the class itself rather than an instance. It receives the class (cls) as the first argument automatically.\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","    Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In object-oriented programming, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or operation in a way specific to their class.\n","    Inheritance plays a central role in enabling polymorphism. A subclass can override methods of its superclass, and the overridden method is executed when called, even if the object is referenced by a variable of the superclass type.\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","    Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement.\n","    This is achieved by designing methods to return the object itself (commonly done with the self keyword), allowing subsequent method calls to be \"chained\" together.\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","    The __call__ method in Python is a special (magic) method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function.\n","    This provides a way to make objects callable, enabling them to behave like functions while retaining their properties and methods as objects.\n","\n","'''\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["                                        ###Practical Questions\n","##1.
